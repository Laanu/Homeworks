*The specific financial problem that FinTech Collective is investing in emerging FinTech startup  companies without the required product-market fit and evidence of revenue scale that other venture capital companies require.

## Landscape:

* FinTech Collective is in the Capital Venture domain that funds FinTech startups. Their focus is on wealth and asset management, banking, lending, payments, insurance, alternative lending, Bitcoin, Blockchain, and Cyber investments. Rapid innovations in FinTech infrastructure, FinTech companies embedding themselves within specific verticals and platforms, the unbundling and re-bundling of financial services offerings, the rice in challenger banks, and the increasing level of FinTech valuations are some of the major trends. However, because most of this startups are the prototypes/blue prints in thier own specific domain, the people factor is what sets then apart.

* Following a boom for FinTech startups in 2019, FinTech companies have gotten bigger, with the average valuation of the top ten FinTech operators in the United States being $9 billion. In comparison to other companies FinTech Collective seems to be one of the top in this category. 


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!) I think a bit of transparency into how the the company select which startup company to support and push would be good. The website only mentioned that the selection is based on networking. This ultimately would exclude some startups that might actually be great investment. Coupling the humanfactor that the company already utillizing some structure in selecting/pursuing startup will help other startup position themselves as an investment option for the company. This will thereby provide lucritive return of investment.
